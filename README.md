# Project & Portfolio II
## Michael McNees | March 2020

This repository was used to keep track of _Project & Portfolio II_ research and development conducted during class.

## Overview
This course focused mainly on learning the syntactical differences between C# and Javascript. We also took a deeper dive into object-oriented and agile principles. The main project throughout the course consisted of planning, designing, and programming an application in both C# and Javascript.

## Final Project
My final project is called Petly. This app is a reference for pet keepers and animal caretakers to keep track of feeding, habitat maintenance, and training for their animals. The app works through the command line in the C# version and translates the inputs and outputs into `prompt()` and `alert()` within the Javascript version.

## Assignments
I also spent some time working through various Javascript exercises that included debugging existing code, and solving logic puzzles, like FizzBuzz.

In addition to these projects, we worked through implementing JSON and file storage in Javascript applications.

## Outside Learning
I also spent some time during this course, exploring more advanced Javascript-based technologies. These included Gatsby, Typescript, and React.
